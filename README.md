List that contains time slots, in 30-minute intervals. That starts at 8am and ends at 8pm
The company has availability of 8 motorcyclists every 30 min
When someone clicks on one of these boxes they should take a motorcyclist turn. In addition to marking the box in green
If the same user clicks on the same box, he must release the resource, if it was green, he must release the resource, that is, the counter again goes from 7 to 8
If other users have taken all the motorcyclists, the box should appear in red and they should not let me take that time
